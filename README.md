Project 1: This Project is about a digital society. Here two types of users are there admin and members. After login admin can add/edit/delete members/maintenance/gallery. Approve/decline requests of newly registered members. Where as admin and members both can view members, view gallery, view notices, view due maintenance, pay maintenance. Here I have used REST API to discuss about a topic where admin can add discussion topic and members and admin both can comment. For both admin and members Profile, Change Password, Forgot Password options are there.
